<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Fenghua Dong</h1>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">My name is Fenghua Dong and I am currently a graduate student at Cornell University studying Financial Engineering. I did my undergraduate degree at Brandeis University in both Applied Math and Economics. I went directly into my graduate study after my bachelor, so I didn't have any full-time working experience, but I did have 2 terms of internship prior to my graduate study. The most recent one was with Everpine Capital, where I worked there as an investment analyst. Prior to that I completed one term internship in marketing at Easytrasfer in China. Beside school and work, I participated 2 projects during undergraduate study which are Portfolio Risk Analysis and Data Analysis.</p>

<h3>Invesment Analyst Intern-Everpine Capital</h3>

<p>During my internship as an Investment Analyst at <a href="https://www.everpinecapital.com/en/">Everpine Capital Limited</a> in Shanghai, China, from July to August 2021, I engaged in various tasks to support the company's investment decisions. One of my primary responsibilities was to apply data analysis techniques to evaluate the performance of medicine companies and their corresponding sectors using web scraping in Python. I analyzed the collected data using Python and R and produced a report to showcase the differences between Chinese and American consumers in the aesthetic medicine market. Additionally, I managed, cleaned, and processed data from a database for more than 60 medicine-related companies, including major businesses and sector distribution.
<br>
<br>
I also had the opportunity to contribute to the company's investment strategy by assisting in preparing a comprehensive business strategy report. As a result, Everpine Capital Limited was able to invest in the aesthetic medicine industry, which led to an approximate $37,000 profit increase. Overall, my internship at Everpine Capital Limited enabled me to gain valuable experience in investment analysis, data analysis, and business strategy, which will benefit my future career. </p>

<h3> Data Acquisition Project</h3>

<p><b>What I did:</b> Used WRDS/Compustat data to reproduce the NASDAQ index. To accomplish this I had to gather various data sets from the WRDS platform and thoroughly read the documentation. I leveraged the tidyverse to merge these data sets together and calculate daily log returns for each of the constituents in the NASDAQ 100 index. I then downloaded the daily returns of the NASDAQ 100 index from Yahoo finance to validate my analysis.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>what I learned:</b> I learned basic R syntax and common coding etiquette. Additionally, I improved my skills in manipulating and visualizing data using the Tidyverse. </p>

<h3> Webscaping Project</h3>

<p><b>What I did:</b> Webscaped EDGAR company filings for NASDAQ 100 constituent addresses. In particular, I wrote a function that took the company id, pulled in the company's information from the EDGAR company filing, and returned a dataframe with the company's business address. In some instances, some of the data were missing, so I had to adapt my function to compensate for these inconsistencies. I then parsed the states from the company addresses and created a heatmap of the distribution of companies by state.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>What I learned:</b> I learned the basics of reading and analyzing .json files. I also developed skills in writing dynamic functions. Additionally, I paid extra attention to my documentation and comments, ensuring my peers could easily understand my code. </p>

<h3> Portfolio Risk Analysis Project</h3>


<p><b>What I did:</b> First I tested the NASDAQ 100 one-day returns for nomality using a QQ-plot and then a Jarque Bera test. I then calculated the 1% value at risk(VaR) of the Nasdaq-100 Index using two methods: boostrap and a Monte-Carlo simulation. I found that the Monte-Carlo simulation underestimated the downside risk of the Nasdaq-100 Index.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Technical Description:</b> First I calculated the 1% VaR of the Nasdaq-100 Index using a bootstrap method. First I subset my data for one-day stock returns between July 2021 to December 2021. I then sampled 200 days with replacement from my sample and calculated the 1% VaR. I then repeated this procedure 1000 times and calculated the mean and standard deviation. I then took the mean and standard deviation from the distribution of 1-day stock returns to construct a normal distribution for my Monte-Carlo simulation. In the Monte-Carlo simulation, I sampled 200 days with replacement from the normal distribution and calculated the 1% VaR. I then repeated this procedure 1000 times and calculated the mean and standard deviation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>What I learned:</b> I learned the importance of testing for all the conditions before performing a statistical test. In this case, I learned that I cannot blindly apply the Monte-Carlo simulation to my analysis without testing my data for normality first. Additionally, this project has provided me with a basic understanding of how to simulate/generate additional data to fuel my analysis. </p>
